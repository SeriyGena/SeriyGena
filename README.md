## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
**I'm thrilled to have you here.**

**About Me:**
- ðŸŒ±I'm passionate about coding and eager to learn more about Python, especially in the context of data analysis and prediction. However, my day job keeps me quite busy, and I often find myself working hard until sunset, thanks to my diligent managers. But whenever I find a pocket of free time, I love to immerse myself in coding and learning new things.
  
**- ðŸ”­ Projects:**
Table Manipulation: Experimenting with Python libraries like Pandas to handle and analyze tabular data.
Market Prediction: Developing simple prediction functions to understand market trends and behaviors.

**- ðŸ‘¯Goals:**

     1. Enhance my Python skills.
     2. Learn more about data analysis and prediction techniques.
     3. Share my journey and projects with fellow enthusiasts.
